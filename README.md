## PROJECT TITLE
Analysis and Prediction of "Mall_Customers.csv" of phonix small to find out how many customers are visited to a particular shop. On the basis of this prediction of annual income vs spending scores.

## DISCLAIMER
In this particular datset we assume annual income as centroid and spending score from the range "1 to 100" called as "DATA NODES OF THE CLUSTERS" PROBLEM STATMENT The american finance market as per the GDP of 2011,'phoniex_tryllums' as in the first range in the out of file.The owner wants to be exact which particular shop or a products. Search in different type of clusters in entire mall

As a data science engineer predict the futuristic financial market per up[coming GDP ray.Based on number of clusters

The client want atleast top 5 clusters-SHOP

## CONCLUSION According to the model basics predictoin using machine learning "KM" "k is clustering".

We found that "cluster 1" which consists red is highest cluster,Which attach more than 50 datanodes.

## REFERENCES: The model building algorithm devlop for all kinds of clusteration values.The "yellow spot represent CENTROID".
